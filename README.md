# CrumbUtil

A utility library for crumbleworks projects.

### Java Version

The library is designed to work against Java8. And will stay that way for the forseeable future.

### Why?

This project was started about a decade ago when apache commons and google guava were the big two utility libraries everyone used. And they were big, clunky and unweildy. So we built our own.
